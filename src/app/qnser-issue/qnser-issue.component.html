          <p> The code that you listed above is basically your implementation details of a - Transport Client element pointing to an instance of Elasticsearch Server i.e. this defines your persistent layer by using Spring Data.
            <br>
            This code will be used by your elasticsearch repositories i.e. repositories that you define by extending - ElasticsearchRepository from Spring Data.
            <br>
            You need to edit @EnableElasticsearchRepositories in code listed by you to actually point to package where you are keeping your repository definitions - no other call would be needed.
            When you are going to write/index data to elasticsearch, you work with ElasticsearchRepository interface and you need to define your own repositories and these repositories work with instances as per listing in your code.
            <br>
            Hope it helps !!
